# **Topic I studied Today:**

Today I learned about the Ethernet protocol very deeply and also the wireshark tool  by capturing packets in the real time, Learned about the little basics of the burpsuite by doing half of the room in the Tryhackme.

**What do I mean by the Ethernet Protocol:**

Today I continued to my Network+ course and started the new section of Ethernet Switching and in that understood the ethernet protocol little bit in depth, first I whenever I heared the name ethernet I always had that ethernet lan cable which is connected to my pc, But after learning about the ethernet than came to know that ethernet is itself a group of techonologies or protocol which mainly live in the 2 layer of the OSI Model,

I learned about the CSMA/CD thing, and some network infrastructure device which define the collison domain in the network and broadcast domain.

**Got Hands on the wireshark tool by learning about the TCP 3-way handshake.**

I just captured network traffic in the wireshark and sat to analyse that first, I filtered out the DNS protocol and then went through all the DNS packets, and also saw that dns queries that my pc asked the router which I searched on my browser, then I shifted my focus to the TCP protocol and then saw that 3-way handshake that my pc make to that server before actual data transfer there I saw that SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK packet and after that TLS protocol which is used to discuss the encryption algorithm both my pc and the server is gonna use for the communication then the actual communication started which was obviously encrypted saying the Application data.

I today watched a youtube video of David Bombal to learn more about the tcp 3-way handshake that happens in the wireshark then got to know more about the syn flags and those two important numbers the ISN (Initial sequence number) and the ACK no.( Acknowledgement no.) how these two numbers are used by both the client and server and how the both use the acknowledgement no. for the reliability of the packet.

I still think I learning a slow like there is more time I am still not focused and learning only a little few things.
