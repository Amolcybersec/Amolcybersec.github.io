# **Things I learned Today**
Posting this day late because of my Mid-sem exams although I tried to learn in the journey, Today I just revised old topics in the cybersecurity from the notes and also revised a room on the Tryhackme platform.
I just taught to not learn new topics during my end-sem exams and only revise the old concept, don't know how much can I continue by this but will see.
