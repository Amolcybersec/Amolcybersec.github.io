# **Things I learned Today**
Today again I was busy with the college projects, but still completed one room in the tryhackme path where I learned about the SOC Lvl 1 alert triaging and escalation process.
1. There are some alerts which are truly positive and need imediate actions on it then we escalate the alert to the L2 analyst.
2. Learned the importance of the alert reporting which helps the L2 analyst to save time to know about the alert and can proceed faster.
3. in the alert reporting we answer the five Ws the who,when,what,why and where
4. leanred the process of the escalation and also did hands on practice in the Tryhackme SOC simulator invironment by writing a good report of the alert and escalating the alert ot the L2 analyst.
5. learned the importance of the communication and some criticals steps what should be done while some circumstances.
6. also learned that it's ok to escalate the L2 for support on those alerts in which I am feeling little difficulty to understand.
