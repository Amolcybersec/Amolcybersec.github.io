# What I learned Today
Today I did one room of the Cyber Security 101 path on Tryhackme and learned the fundamentals of the SIEM, why they are used, what does they do, how the logs are collected, and how they do the analysis and raise
an alert and revised some topics in the networking , and tried to do a ctf challenge on Tryhackme Called Cyborg, which I wasn't able to complete.

### The SIEM Room
- Learned about the different types of Logs like the host centric and the network centric logs.
- Learned how they are collected by all the devices and ingested in the SIEM tools, some provide some application, some also have option to upload files in the SIEM to do quick analysis.
- Then learned how the SIEM raise an alert by the predefined rules.
- In the end did a hand on practical in the simulated SIEM evironment by stopping the alert to solve the end quizess.

### Cyborg CTF
I thought to solve a CTF challenge today on the Tryhackme platform and this was the first ever CTF I choosed to do, it had 4 questions in total and 2 were of the ctf, I abled to perform the nmap scan on the target
to solve the first two questions and the rest two were the actual ctf and we have to find the user.txt and root.txt file to answer and for that we have to use the two open ports the http one and the SSH one, but I
couldn't do anything after finding out the two open ports and in the end when went for the writeups then I got to know that we have to use tool like the gobster and Hashcat which are the offensive tools, and we have
a dedicated section in the path, But I just skipped that section thinking that I will do it in the end and that is why I couldn't solve the CTF, so to solve the ctf I actually need to complete the rooms as it is 
mentioned in the path.

**So this was all for the Day-11 in the journey there are lot of things going in my head, doubting myself, not learning enough, thinking its too hard to solve and learn things, and much more things, but the actuall
thing is we have to face all those things in order to grow in this field, and these days will surely payoff one day**
