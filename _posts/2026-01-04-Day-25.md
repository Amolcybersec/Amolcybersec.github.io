# *Completed the Cyber security 101 path and got the certificate*

# **Things I did Today**
So today I continued the rest of the topics in the network security fundamentals section of the Network+ course and completed the section, and also did the last two rooms in the cyber security 101 path on the tryhackme
and achieved the complition certificate.

# Tryhackme Achievement
Today went through the last two rooms of the OWASP Top 10 2025 and completed those rooms, they were about application design flaws and insecure data handling these rooms felt little tought because I have to go through the codes
and I am not good in coding yet so had to take little help of the writeups of these rooms.
1. Learned about the application design flaws which lead to the security configurations, software supply chains and insecure design got learn their importance, how this occurs and how can it be prevented.
2. in the second room learned about the insecure data handling which caused by cryptographic failures and software intigrity failures and how much they are important.

Doing these rooms were little hard took little help from the writeups and learned the concept, after doing the last two rooms my path was completed and then I got the certificate of completion of this certificate 
which was worth getting.

# Networking
Continued the rest of the topics in the Network security fundamentals and completed the section
1. Learned about device hardening, what steps I should do to harden the device to increase the security, like disabling the unknown and uneeded services in the host, installing endpoint security software like the anti-malware, firewalls and etc..
2. I really learned so much things in blue team perspectives and will apply this knowledge.
3. Learned about the active defense and honeypot, thier uses, how using this can help us understand the attackers tactics and in threat hunting.

Completed the Network security Fundamentals, form tomorrow I will start the Network Attacks section where I will get to learn about the modern day network attacks, Now the focus in the Network+ course is moving towards
the network attacks and preventing them, now I am getting little deeper in the defensive side of the networking in the network+ course which will really help me build my SOC skills for blue teaming.

This was all about the Day-25 of the journey, its good to see my self how far I have come there are days when I learn too much and there are days when I don't feel like study but I also try to learn that day, and today
I got achievement by achieving the Tryhackme CyberSecurity 101 certificate this shows the daily consistency and the daily efforts. Literally learned so many things from the cyber security 101 path now my focus will be the SOC Lvl1 path where I will be mainly
focusing in the defensive side and make myself ready for SOC blue teaming roles by gaining up the skill
