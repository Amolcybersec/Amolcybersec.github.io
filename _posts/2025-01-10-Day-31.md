# **Things I learned Today**
Today again was the busy day where I had to go with my family for some important work that costed me the whole day and just learned a two topics in the network+ course and completed the Network security fundamentals section in it and couldn't do any Tryhackme Room.
1. Learned about the social enginnering attacks and it types like the phising,tailgating, piggybanking, shouldersurfing and Dumpster diving.
2. Learned about the actuall meaning of the malware and the different types of malware like the viurs, worm, Trojan horse, ransomware, spyware, rootkit.

This is all I was able to do on the Day-31 of the journey,was busy with family and didn't learn anything much the main guilt is that I didn't learn today on the Tryhackme today, now days I am feeling like I am feeling
loosing my old energy of learning things, some last few days was really busy including today and because of this I couldn't able to learn enough and practice, but still trying to study daily and learn atleast what I can.
