# **What things I did Today**
Honestly I didn't learn anything today didn't even revised any older topics or also missed my Tryhackme streak today, looks like I am loosing in this journey, I have my exams in few days and I also not able to properly study for my upcoming
end sem exams, days are going to waste, just getting distracted again.
