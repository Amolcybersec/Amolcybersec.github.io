# **Things I learned Today** 
I continued my SOC learning path on the Tryhackme and completed two rooms today learning about the SIEM and a very popular SIEM tool called Splunk.
1. First I refreshed my concept of the Introduction to SIEM by learning the Room again which I have learned earlier.
2. Then I completed one more room abou the Splunk basics.
3. Learned about the three main component of the splunk which was forwarder which helps to send the logs to the indexer for processing, Indexer which actually stores the logs by normalizing and pasing it and in the end the search head which heps us search in the logs which is done by the SPL(Search Processing Language).
4. Learned the UI of the splunk like the splunk bar, apps panel, splunk dashboard.
5. in the end did the hands on practice by ingesting VPN logs to the splunk and then searched the desired queries to find out some answers to the quizes, doing this really gave me a hands on practical of the Splunk tool and also got to know that how the SIEM soulutions actually work.
