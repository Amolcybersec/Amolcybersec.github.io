# **Things I learned Today**
So Today I Completed learning one room from the Tryhackme Path about SOAR (Security Orchestration,Automation, and Response) and half of the day spent preparing for my End semester exams, next few weeks I will be busy much in the End-sem exams.
1. Learned about the core SOC challenges and then What actually is SOAR and how does it solve those challenges of the SOC Team.
2. Learned about that tree core strenght of SOAR Orchestration which helps Analysts by coordinating all the security tools inside in a SOC which by which analysts can do everything from the SOAR rather than going on each tool.
3. The Second capability Automation which is done with the help of Playbooks it helps analyst to save time and handle hundred of threats without stressing out.
4. and the Last Response, SOAR can also automate the response on the basis of desired alerts as the playbooks.
5. Then I learned about building a playbook and then to get hands on experience also builded a threat intel playbook in the Tryhackme Simulated enviornment.
