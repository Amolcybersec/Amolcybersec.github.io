# **Things I learned Today**
Today I completed one room in the Tryhackme path which was about the introduction to Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and learned so much things in it.
1. Learned the basics concepts of the EDR like what does it actually do, different types of EDR solution in the market, and its basic three pillars visiblity, Detection and Response.
2. Learned how the different between the EDR solution and the Antivirus, and also mapped out the importance of using EDR solution over any antivurs solutions.
3. Learned how the EDR actually works like the Agents and the console where all the agents collect the telemetry which is also know as the data and send it to the console where all the telemetry is then reviewed and then the Detection rules apply to rasie an alert with the full details which help SOC analyst in it analysis.
4. Learned about the capabilites of the EDR Detection and Response, like on what feautres it can detect and what are the responses we can take as a SOC analyst to migitate an attack on the particular endpoint
5. In the end also practiced on the simulated EDR on the Tryhackme platform and solved some end quizes.

This is what I did on the Day-33 in the journey, I know I am learning very little or not learning enough that I used to learn in a day, these days I am pretty much slow in learning and soon will comeback with my old energy of learning, I also too feel guilt sometimes when I don't do much.
