# **Things I learned Today**
Today I had my first E.T.E exam of the sem in a proctered mode for which I had to go to college and so to not stop learning daily, I completed one room on the Tryhackme path learning about the SOC metrics and Objectives.
1. Learned the core internals metrics like the alerts count, flase positive Rate, alert escalation rate and Threat Detection rate.
2. and also the Performance metrics like the MTTD, MTTA, MTTR which help us measure how good our SOC team in performing to the alerts and incident, and how can we improve it also learned about the SLA.
3. en the end explored ways to track and improve the metrics and also did a hands on practice scenarios where I improved the metrices of the SOC team by defining the root cause and the right measure to improve it.

That is what I did and learnt on the Day-32 of the journey, days are not going well in learning there is so much of distractions and work to do these days and because for that I can't focus much on cybersecurity.
