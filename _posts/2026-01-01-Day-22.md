# *Happy New Year Guys*

# **Things I learned today**
Today I was busy on raoming around on the 1st day of the year celebrating New Year and only studied one thing and that was I continued my Network+ course and finished the Network services section by finishing the last topic 
learning about the QOS(Quality of Service), and didn't do anything else, I also missed my Tryhackme streak today feeling bad for it.
