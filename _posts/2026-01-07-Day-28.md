# **Things I Learned Today**
Today's day was busy in doing the college end sem project and didn't learn much in cybersecurity just completed one room of the SOC path on the Tryhackme and learned about SOC L1 alert Triage
1. Learned about the key role responsibilites of the SOC L1 by doing the practical of triage alerting in the Tryhackme SIEM environment.
2. Learned how first the alerts occur and then how a SIEM tool raise a alert by its rules from those thousand and million of logs from different different devices.
3. Then moved one step forward and then focused on how does alert look like got to know about the different properties of the alert like the alert time, verdict, severity, status and other fields too.
4. Then learned about the prioritazion of the alerts and learned the very important concept that don't always first try to triage the critical severity level alerts and always start with the low severity levels alerts because if its actually a true positive alert then the hacker from the older breach is likely already dumping your data, while the "newcomer" has just started the discovery.
5. then did the practical of triaging an alert and triaged 3 alerts in the SIEM environment by changing the verdict, status and also writing the comment of the alert.

This was all in the Day-28 in the journey couldn't able to learn more as I was busy in the college end sem project but still I tried to learn and completed one room,Today I couldn't continue on the network+ and also did not do any networking practicals.
Few days are gonna be busy in college practicals and also my end sem gonna start in few weeks, but I will not stop learning and will try to learn daily as much as I can and not break my consistency and discipline.
