# **What is happening**
So, I haven't posted since 18 of janauary and stopped my journey at the day 39 and the reason was my End semester exams as I said earlier that my exams are going to conducted and they are, that's why in these days I was just busy in that
I have 2 exams left more on the 4th and 6th of Feb and it will completely end on the 6th of feb.

During these days I didn't learn anything in cybersecurity neither did any rooms in tryhackme and is on a streak freeze,didn't revise anything I was completly stopped in cybersecurity. I am still there where I left on the Day-39 of this journey, same path the SOC LVL 1, on that same section of the networking+
course and haven't leanred anything till now from that day, nothing new or neither nothing revised.

I started this journey to learn cybersecurity daily and document everything daily on the linkedin and my personal blog post so that I can become accountable, learn where I am doing mistakes, and do not stop even this time
and keep my promise which I broke everytime earlier in the past and which led to cost of wasting 2 years of my college where I could have done more if I was serious about this in the starting year. I also told in my the learning days before my exams that I will try to atleast revise those topics which I have learnt but those things were also couldn't be possible.

But I stopped learning in this sem end exams because for me its very difficult to study during the exams that's why I was completely off from the cybersecurity journey, and there were also not much gap between the exams in which I could have thaught of learning
cybersecurity even a little bit.

Its beed 10 days in the journey where I didn't do anything and now two exams are still left in which I have plenty of time to prepare for them, so I think I can bounce back and resume my learning journey where I left off, I will still not learn anything net until I get completely rid off my exams but try to revise
the old topics which I have learnt earlier and even its for 1hr or 1:30hr a day, on the 3rd and 5th of feb I will be completely busy in my exams revision because I don't have much gaps between those exams.

I always finded difficult to get good marks in the college exams,I don't have that shiny cgpa to show off and I also didn't become seriously in my starting of college years that's why I am here now learning skills that I know I defitely will.

Thanks for supporting me and understanding me.
