# **Things I did Today**
So Today was my project evaluation day in college and my most of the time of the Day was busy in college doing that project stuff but still in the end of the Day I Sat to study and completed One Room in the Tryhackme
SOC Lv1 path and learned about the SOC Workbooks and Lookups.
1. I learned about the Identitiy inventory where I we can find the detials about all the employees(user accounts), services and thier details view like what are thier roles, what action they are allowed to do means thier privileges, which helps us to dig deep to the alert.
2. Then learned about the Assets inventory where we can find all the assests within that compnay or the organizations like what is the use of this server what does it do, how many total workstations are there in the organizations which belongs to whom, these types of things which will help us to know the context about the alert like if someone accessed some machine containing hostname HSO-FILESER as an example then this assets inventory gonna help us know that what is this Machine particularly doing and who all acess to this these types of things.
3. Next I got to know about the Network diagrams which is very essential to understand because this will give me the whole network Map of the company or the organization like whats the subnet of the server, in what subnet the employees actually are and who access to what networks these things will eventually help me to know about the IP based Alerts in my SOC Lv1 analyst role where I will get to know that what the IP mentioned in the SIEM alert is actually trying to do and what is classify that it is a false postive or True positive for further investigations.
4. Then I Learned about the Workbooks and those three stage in it.
     
   **Enrichment:** Use Threat Intelligence and identity inventory to get information about the affected user
   **Investigation:** Using the gathered data and SIEM logs, make your verdict if the login is expected
   **Escalation:** Escalate the alert to L2 or communicate the login with the user if necessary
   
5. and in the end practiced the workbooks by actually aligning the steps in the workflow diagram and really learned that what things I should do as a SOC analyst Lv1 and I encouter any alerts with the help of workbooks.

This was all about the Day-30 of the journey, 30 Days completed in the journey learned daily whether it was that productive day where I learned so much things or whether it was days where I didn't feel like studying but still did,
and also with these few days where I couldn't able to focus that much to this learning journey because of the college things, but I showed up and I learned something, I have the logs of those daily learning which really showed me that I can.

Did I become that pro in cybersecurity?-No
Am I the same Amol when I started the journey and was beginner-No 

I learned so much things in these 30 days of journey about networking,about the linux, those tryhackme rooms with practical hands on practice really thought me so much things, Now I am confident in networking can acutally explain to someone very easily how the whole networking
things works, know about the linux OS, use daily linux not much but yeah, Learned about those concepts and acutall meaning of those cybersecurity words which seems unknown to me first.

This was just the beginning, its still to cover more and learn more,the journey continues..
