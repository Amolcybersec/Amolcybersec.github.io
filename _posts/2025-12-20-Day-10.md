# **🧠 Topic I studied Today:**

Today I Continued my Network+ course on the udemy and learned about the new topic in networking called the VLAN, and did not do anything else.

Today I learned only few things in the cybersecurity and touched only the networking part, Today I wasted my most of the time I could have learned more things without wasting my whole day in the distractions, I didn't do any room today I just self doubting my self that I should do start the new section or not regarding the blue team, that's why I have just been on hold on the Tryhackme platform not learning anything new,

there is nothing to tell about today, Learned about the VLAN in networking that why it is done and little bit how-

1. Learned VLAN is done mainly for separating the broadcast domain in the network on the layer 2 of the OSI with the Use of switches.

2. Learned about the tagging of the VLAN, the access port and the Trunk port, the default VLAN and what are the thins is essential when configuration the VLAN.

3. Learned that how this VLAN increases the security and the performance of the nework.


Learned only few thing looks like I am just lagging behind more and not doing anything acutally to work.
