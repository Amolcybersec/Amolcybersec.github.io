# **Topic I studied Today:**

Today Learned the file permission section from the course and also did one room on Tryhackme Learning about the Incident reponse fundamentals.

# Things I learned from the THM room:-
1. I learned about what is actually a incident is and the different types of incident, and the severity level of incident can vary from organizations to organizations.
2. I learned about the two different incident response framework which is provided by NIST and SANS.
3. Two different books or guide which help us at the time of the Incident , the Playbook and Runbook. Playbook is what to do and the Runbook is how to do.
4. Then practiced a Incident Response after doing the incident by download the malicious file from the email and then eradicating it.

# Linux
