# **Topic I studied Today:**
Today I learned the rest of the things in Nmap room on the tryhackme and learned about these things.

1. Using Nmap for the evaison of Firewall,did the practical by answering the question in the end of the room where the machine was blocking the ICMP packets to used the -Pn argument to skip the ICMP ping request on the host and check all the ports.

2. Nmap scripting engine, Learned about the scripting feature the nmap have, the scripts which helps nmap to increase its capabilities by scanning for vulnerabilities in the target machine by their service and the scripts which are also used for exploiting.

Scripts also have arguments, and it differs from scripts to scripts.I also learned about how to search for the scripts from the command line and how can we can get help of each scripts the Nmap have.

I didn't learned much today as I had college classes today and didn't get enough time to learn.

Tomorrow goal is to continue my section from the cybersecurity 101 path and do the practice of the nmap tool by using it.
