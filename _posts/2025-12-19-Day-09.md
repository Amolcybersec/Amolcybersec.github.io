# **Topic I studied Today:**

In reality today I didn't learned anything new or anything much, today had classes in the college and I was so tired after the college that didn't learn anything new I just practiced some Linux commands in the Labs in the college and revised networking from notes in between the lectures.

Today's day was literally the most unproductive or we can say non-learning day in the whole journey till the now.

I also didn't even complete a whole room on the Tryhackme just figuring out what should I do should I continue the new section in the path which is the defensive security solutions or just keep working on the basics to strengthen them, I have still left to learn more about the fundamentals in the Networking, in the opearting system specially the Linux I have learned that enough that I can use linux as my daily driver and learn daily.

I think I should keep learn the things in the right direction, I don't want to be that guy who do's new rooms on the Tryhackme and keep forgetting the older ones, I want to practice daily the real practical things which matters the most , there are days when I just focus on the theory and never practice on that day, that is the day I don't feel like I am not learning enough, or I am just forgetting what things I learned earlier.

That is what happened on the day 9 of the journey
