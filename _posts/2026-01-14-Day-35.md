#**Things I learned Today**
Posting this on the next day because yesterday I was completely busy in my college projects for my End-sem Exams and because of that I was'nt able to post, but I didn't stop learning and Continue my Tryhackme path and did half a room of Elastic stack basics.
1. Learned about what actually is Elastic stack and where and why it is used.
2. Learned its four main components Beats which is data collection agent, Logstash Data input/Filter/output, Elastic Search which index and Store Data and the last Kibana which helps us in the Analysis and Kibana.
3. Learned about the different panels in the Kibana like the logs, field pane, index pattern, search bar, filter and some more things.
4. Then Did hands on practice on the Elastic stack where I explored the Discover Tab and searced queries in the VPN_Connections index, applied time filters to get logs of specific time period, understood the field pane properly by looking out each field and also clicking the + button next to it to use it as filter to get more specific result.

This was about the Day-35 of the journey,didn't do much things only explored the basics of Elastic Stack tool like its overview and gained some really good hands on practice of the Discover tab in it. Days are going not well in learning there are lot of work going with the college and most of my time is going in the college stuff but still try to learn something daily
From next week I am going to have my End-sem exams so the next two weeks will also be more busier balancing out between exams and cybersecurity.
