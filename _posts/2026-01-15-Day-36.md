# **Things I learned Today**
So Today I went to college for the Project End-term and it consumed most of the time of the day but still I managed to learn and continued the Half room which I did yesterday on Tryhackme Path abou the Elastic Stack.
1. I Continued the room and learned about the KQL (Kibana Query Language) and searched the logs by generating queries in the Search bar, I learnt about the free text search and the Field-base search, I did hands on practicals by searching the logs by generating both Field-base search and Free text search with some Operators like AND, OR and NOT.

This is what I done on the Day-36 of the journey, after getting tired of half of the Day in the college project evaluation this is what I managed to learn to stay consistent in learning. I really learnt lot of thing from this Room,
I explored the key components of ELK, which involve collecting, parsing, searching, and displaying a vast number of logs. I also saw its powerful searching capabilities within logs. I put Myself in the shoes of an SOC analyst and investigated an organization's VPN logs from within ELK. 
Lastly, I practiced making visualizations and dashboards within ELK, which gives a single pane of glass for detecting malicious patterns.
