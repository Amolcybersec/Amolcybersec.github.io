# **WHOAMI**

My name is Amol kumar and I am a college student. Today I am starting out my journey learning cybersecurity in public. I always had some sort of interest in Hacking when I used to watch those cool hollywood movies in my school years or even now, where the side kick of hero just help the hero to save the world by hacking into villain's stuff and breaching its security, I know it looks like cheesy but that is what fascinated me in this cybersecurity world and most probably you guys also have been fascinated with those cool sci-fiction movies if I am not wrong.

Far forward to now I am in my college and gonna graduate in couple of months and I decided to go all in cybersecurity, like gonna pursue it and the decision was not like the instant , For years, cybersecurity lived in the back of my mind as something I wanted to pursue but never truly committed to.
I didn’t have the discipline.
I didn’t have a plan.
And honestly, I wasn’t consistent.

But today — 10 December 2025 — I made a decision:

👉 I’m going all-in on cybersecurity.
👉 I’m choosing the Blue Team path.
👉 And I’m learning in public.

 
# 📍 Where I am right now

I am not a complete beginner like I know some sort of stuff in cybersecurity. I know things like the CIA,vulnerability, exploit and some more others terms or concept.
I have Some free courses on cybersecurity on the cisco learning platform not complete yet but yes I did.

I know the beginning roadmap of going in the cybersecurity like first get the fundamental things like have the concept of how computers work, how they talk to each other, and computer networks and operating systems specially linux and then move forward according to the decided Team like mine is Blue team.

# 🧰What I have done till yet

I subscribed to the Tryhackme platform its been 20 days and I do daily rooms on that, I have completed the Pre-security path where I got to know about the roles in the cybersecurity and all the basic fundamentals we need to start in the cybersecurity , got to learn about the networking, the TCP/IP and OSI Model, how packets travel all over the internet,and some HTTP fundamentals. 

Learned about the Windows and its internals , Linux commands starting from its history and some more stuff.

Right now I am on the cybersecurity 101 path on the Tryhackme and learned about the networking protocols, wireshark, nmap, TCP dump tool and some concept of cryptography and hasing and learned to use some offensive tools also like the John the ripper tool and some more..

So you can say I am not a complete beginner or not even pro in this just starting out the things and discovering more while learning.


**🕸️ Computer Networks**- For computer networks I everytime just got in the loop of searching best or full course which can teach me networking hoping here and there not completing anything fully.

But now I am just learning from a course on the udemy which is on the Network+ by dion training and make notes too while learning haven't finish it yet there is more things to cover in that course.



**🐧Linux**- Linux is also a crucial thing in cybersecurity because most of the servers run on the Linux OS and most of the security tools is made to run on the Linux specially those CLI ones , that's why its important to learn.

I also hopped here and there in search of full and detail course from which I can learn the all about linux, but in this journey of searching more information taught me that we have to start first even we are not perfect so finally I started learning from this Linux Course on Udemy and have completed some of the modules in it

Learned about some commands like:
the basic shell navigation commands , some file system commands, and about the user account management on the linux and much more and even much more left to learn.


**🔒Security Concepts**- Learned about the concept of the cybersecurity from the free course on the Cisco Netcad academy and the ICS2 CC course which they provide freely but also haven't completed those yet.

Some concepts which I learned here were:
The CIA triad, about SIEM things,Phising, social engineering,firewall,and some more things too..


**🌱 The Journey Ahead**

Cybersecurity is huge.
Massive.
Endless.

And that’s exactly why I’m documenting everything — so I can see how far I’ve come, To get disciplined and build concistency and maybe help a few others who are on the same path.

I’ll be sharing:

    My notes
    My labs
    My experiences
    My mistakes

    And everything I learn along the way

If you’re interested in Blue Teaming, cybersecurity fundamentals, hacking labs, or the journey of someone starting from scratch —
you’re in the right place.

This is just the beginning.

Let’s grow together. 🔐🔥
